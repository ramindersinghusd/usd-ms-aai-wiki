What is the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)?
Imagine you've created a fantastic recipe (your code) and you want to share it with the world. The GPLv3 is like a set of rules you attach to your recipe that says:

Everyone can use your recipe for free.
Everyone can look at your recipe and change it.
Everyone can share your changed recipe.
But here's the crucial part: If someone changes your recipe and shares it, they must also share their changes under the same rules (GPLv3). It's about keeping the "freedom" of the code alive and flowing.

Expectations from the Author (You, who created the repo)
Granting Freedoms: By applying GPLv3, you are explicitly giving everyone the following freedoms:

The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what they wish. (This requires access to the "source code," which GitHub naturally provides).
The freedom to redistribute copies.
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
Providing Source Code: You've already done this by putting it on GitHub. The GPLv3 requires that the source code be readily available.

No Additional Restrictions: You cannot add any further restrictions on how people use, modify, or distribute your code beyond what the GPLv3 itself specifies.

No Warranty: The license explicitly states that there is no warranty for the program. This means if someone uses your code and something goes wrong, you're not liable.

Expectations from the Consumer/User (Someone who forks or uses the repo)
Respecting the License (Keeping it Free): This is the biggest one. If you take this code, modify it, and distribute your modified version (even if it's just a small part), your modified version must also be licensed under the GPLv3. You can't make it proprietary or add new restrictions. This is often called the "copyleft" effect.

Providing Source Code (Your Changes): If you distribute your modified version, you must also provide the source code for your changes. This means making it accessible to anyone who receives your modified version. For a GitHub fork, this is often handled naturally by the nature of GitHub, but if you distribute the software outside of GitHub, you'd need to ensure the source is available.

Attribution (Though not explicitly in GPLv3, it's good practice): While the GPLv3 doesn't strictly require you to mention the original author in every single instance, it's considered good practice and often necessary to comply with copyright law in general to acknowledge where you got the original code. You should retain any existing copyright notices.

Informing Users of the License: Anyone who receives a copy of the software from you (whether it's the original or your modified version) must also be informed that it's under the GPLv3 and be given a copy of the license.

No Reverse Engineering Restrictions: You cannot add restrictions that prevent others from reverse engineering the software.

In essence, the GPLv3 is designed to maximize the freedom of software users and ensure that software, once made free, stays free for everyone. It's a powerful license that has been instrumental in the growth of the open-source movement.
